<aside class="notes">
Two outbreaks occurred simultaneously in 1976 with Ebola Sudan and Ebola Zaire. They lasted approximately 2 months each and both were fueled by high transmission within local hospitals. At the time, they were reusing syringes. The hospitals were closed and that halted the outbreaks. Ebola Sudan emerged again in 1979 from the same factory that caused the first outbreak. Then, the virus went silent for 15 years. In 1994, there was a single person infected in Ivory Coast with a new strain. Also in 1994, Zaire Ebola became generically active in the border region between Gebon and Republic of Congo. The 1995 Kikwit outbreak was the next big isolated emergence. Then in the 2000s there were a number of outbreaks in Central Africa and the first in Uganda along with the emergence of Bundibugyo. Finally there was the huge Zaire Ebola virus outbreak in 2014.

Of course the coloring won’t normally be there but the shape is characteristic. In the Reston Ebola virus situation, they put this in the electron microscope before they knew what it was. When they saw it and had never used protection, they freaked out a bit.

It makes it easier for me to categorize these things in my head. So the two common ones here are ZEBOV and SEBOV. ZEBOV generally has a mortality about two as high as SEBOV. Similarly, Reston cannot infect humans at all.

It is important to note that this is exactly what we see for things like H5N1 and other zoonotic viruses. Each time they emerge, they are somewhat diverged from the earlier outbreaks. You can actually glean a fair amount of epidemiological information from evolutionary studies.

<aside class="notes">
<p>The A82V mutation swept the EBOV population early in 2014 and lead to increased transmissibility of the virus. Those of us that were studying these sorts of things had an ongoing argument about this outbreak. Most epidemiologists argued that nothing had changed substantially about the virus and that this resulted from an infection occuring near larger population centers than ever before.</p>
Evolutionary biologists appeared to stay somewhat skeptical either way. The data just wasn’t there to make that determination early in the epidemic.

<li>Lots of controversy exists surrounding this issue</li>

<h2>How do outbreaks persist?</h2>

<li>Differential also includes Measles, Lassa Fever, Typhoid and Meningoccocal infection (also Marburg)</li>

<li><p>Easily passed in virtually all body fluids</p></li>
<li>Nosocomial transmission is the single biggest issue
<ul>
<li>Of 16,000 confirmed cases in 2014-2015, about 1000 were healthcare workers</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Household caretakers and burial practitioners are also at high risk</p></li>
<li>Cultural practices contribute to spreading
<ul>
<li>The virus persists in dead bodies</li>
<li>Elaborate burial rituals can cause super spreading</li>
<li>During recent outbreak, there were teams of people who burned the bodies</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Virus can persist in semen and vaginal secretions for a year or more</p></li>
<li><p>Current WHO recommendation is abstinence for 3 months after symptom onset</p></li>

<h2>How do outbreaks end?</h2>
